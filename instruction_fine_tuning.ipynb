task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.  ### Instruction: Wayne and Bernadette are movie stars heading to the premiere of their latest film. Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Wayne is staying at a hotel close to the premiere theater, and Bernadette is staying at her high-rise apartment in the same city. The drive from Bernadette’s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne’s hotel. If it takes Wayne four minutes to be driven to the theater, how much earlier should Bernadette leave than Wayne to get to the theater first? Solve this problem.   ### Response: The drive from Wayne’s hotel to the premiere theater is 4 * 5 = 30 minutes. The drive from Wayne’s apartment to the premiere theater is 30 minutes * 4 = 120 minutes.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.  ### Instruction: Wayne and Bernadette are movie stars heading to the premiere of their latest film. Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Wayne is staying at a hotel close to the premiere theater, and Bernadette is staying at her high-rise apartment in the same city. The drive from Bernadette’s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne’s hotel. If it takes Wayne four minutes to be driven to the theater, how much earlier should Bernadette leave than Wayne to get to the theater first? Solve this problem.   ### Response: The drive from Wayne’s hotel to the premiere is 4 times as long as the drive from the hotel to the premiere, so 4*5 = 20 minutes.
